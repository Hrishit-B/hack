# ML Workflow Automation Tool

The main goal is to simplify the machine learning workflow for users with different levels of
expertise. We ask the user for certain inputs like the dataset file or folder, nature of the dataset, and the type of ML problem. We then perform data preprocessing and feature selection (if necessary), and train relevant models or build neural networks for the data and present a comparative analysis of the models trained, along with downloadable model weight files in any required format.


## Installation

Install all required models using pip

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
    
## Deployment

Find out which ML model suits your needs by installing our package using pip

```bash
    pip install curdrice
```
